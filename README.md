# RSS feed reader in Rust

This is a simple RSS feed reader written in Rust. It is a learning project for me to get to know the language and its ecosystem.

## Features

Reads a list of RSS feeds and keywords from `feeds.txt` and `keywords.txt` respectively. Then it fetches the feeds and prints the entries that contain any of the keywords.

## Usage

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
